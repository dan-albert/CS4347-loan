Classifying Loan Applications by Applying Machine Learning Algorithms 

Daniel Albert, Chichi Christine

Problem Description
When issuing a loan to an individual, banks must assess a wide variety of factors in order to reach their decision.  Some are rather obvious, such as their past loan history and current income.  New points of consideration however have been introduced by the quickening pace of technology.  Banks have traditionally used an application scorecard in order to assess impartially.  However the human filling it in is still susceptible to mistakes and bias.  By implementing machine learning, banks can maintain algorithms suitable for large amounts of changing data.  The work previously done by humans will be performed with less expense and fewer opportunities for bias, thus relegating them to supervisory roles.  Denied users seeking to use their Right to Explanation can be quickly and accurately pointed to the arbitrating factor.  Both the creditor and consumer benefit from this arrangement.

Brief survey of what has been done and how the proposed work is different
	Various credit scoring models have been proposed, tested and implemented by companies over the past several years.  K-NN, logisic regression, decision tree, support vector machine and neural networks are the most popular machine learning algorithms [1].  As such they have seen seen the most focus.  Addo, Guegan and Hassani compared the efficacy of three machine learning models and three deep learning models.  Elastic Net, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.  Gradient boosting outperformed the other two machine learning models [2].  The machine learning models were generally more accurate than the deep learning models, but there is potential for this to change in the future [2].
 	Arutjothi and Senthamarai built a classifier based credit analysis model using the combination of Min-Max Normalization and K-Nearest-Neighbor.  The data was normalized prior to classification.  Outliers in the loan_status, income_level and home_ownership attributes were replaced by null.  They then found the minimum error average rate k, built the K-NN model and evaluated their predictions [1].  
	ZestFinance, an AI company founded by Google’s former CIO Douglas Merrill, is one of many companies implementing these models.  They seek to make financial companies more cost-effective by helping them to make accurate credit decisions with machine learning [3].  Their recent software tool ZAML Fair determines the effect of bias in credit data sets, and then creates a model with more fairness attached to it.  The lender is then able to adjust influential variables to increase accuracy while lessening bias [4].
